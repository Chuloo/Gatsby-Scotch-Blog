Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.[4] Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is made easy with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Vue can also function as a web application framework capable of powering advanced single-page applications. - Wikipedia
